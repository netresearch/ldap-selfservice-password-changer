# Onboarding Checklist

Progressive learning path for new developers joining the LDAP Selfservice Password Changer project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Go 1.24+ installed (`go version`)
- [ ] Node.js v16+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] pnpm installed via Corepack (`corepack enable`)
- [ ] Git configured with your credentials
- [ ] Access to LDAP/AD test server (or credentials for development)
- [ ] Code editor with Go and TypeScript support

## Day 1: Project Understanding

### Morning: High-Level Architecture

- Embedded static assets (embed.FS)
- Dual validation pattern (frontend + backend)
- No password storage (LDAP passthrough)

### Afternoon: Setup Development Environment

- [ ] Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/netresearch/ldap-selfservice-password-changer.git`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with LDAP credentials (see [Development Guide](development-guide.md#4-configure-ldap-connection))
- [ ] Build project: `pnpm build`
- [ ] Verify build output: `./ldap-selfservice-password-changer --help`

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Project builds without errors
- ✅ Help text displays all configuration flags
- ✅ No missing dependencies

### End of Day: First Run

- [ ] Start development server: `pnpm dev`
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
- [ ] Inspect form fields (username, current, new, new2)
- [ ] Try password reveal toggle
- [ ] Observe hot reload (edit tailwind.css, save, see changes)

**Reflection Questions**:

1. What are the 4 input fields and their purposes?
2. How does hot reload work (which processes are running)?
3. What port does the server listen on?

---

## Day 2: Code Structure

- [ ] Read [Component Reference: internal/rpc](component-reference.md#go-package-internalrpc)
- [ ] Trace JSON-RPC request flow

**Exercises**:

1. Locate where the server port is defined (`main.go:50`)
2. Find where body size limit is set (`main.go:31`)
3. Identify the single RPC method (`handler.go:49`)

### Afternoon: Validation Logic

- [ ] Read [Component Reference: internal/validators](component-reference.md#go-package-internalvalidators)
- [ ] Understand ASCII range checks for symbols
- [ ] Read [API Reference: Validation Rules](api-reference.md#validation-rules)
- [ ] Compare backend and frontend validators
- [ ] Review [Architecture Patterns: Dual Validation](architecture-patterns.md#dual-validation-frontend--backend)

**Exercises**:

1. What ASCII ranges define symbols? (lines 14-23 in validate.go)
2. Why validate both frontend and backend?
3. How many validators exist? (4: numbers, symbols, uppercase, lowercase)

### End of Day: Make a Small Change

- [ ] Add console.log to `app.ts` to print validation errors
- [ ] Save file and observe TypeScript recompile
- [ ] Test in browser, check browser console
- [ ] Remove the console.log

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Can locate and modify TypeScript files
- ✅ Familiar with developer console debugging

---

## Day 3: Frontend Architecture

### Morning: TypeScript Modules

- [ ] Read [Component Reference: validators.ts](component-reference.md#typescript-module-validatorsts)
- [ ] Understand validator function factories (`mustBeLongerThan(n)` returns validator)
- [ ] Read [Component Reference: app.ts](component-reference.md#typescript-module-appts)
- [ ] Trace form submission flow (`app.ts:134-188`)

**Exercises**:

1. How is `specialCharacters` array generated? (ASCII loops)
2. What's the difference between `mustNotBeEmpty` and `mustBeLongerThan`? (static vs parameterized)
3. Where is form validation triggered? (`form.onchange`)

### Afternoon: Template System

- [ ] Read [Component Reference: internal/web/templates](component-reference.md#go-package-internalwebtemplates)
- [ ] Explore `index.html` template structure
- [ ] Understand how server options inject into JavaScript (`index.html:185-192`)
- [ ] Review [Architecture Patterns: Template Rendering](architecture-patterns.md#template-rendering-with-embedded-html)

**Exercises**:

1. Where are password reveal icons defined? (EyeSlashIcon, EyeIcon templates)
2. How does the server pass `MinLength` to frontend? (template data injection)
3. What happens on successful password change? (form hidden, success container shown)

### End of Day: API Call Flow

- [ ] Set breakpoint in `app.ts:148` (fetch call)
- [ ] Submit form with valid data
- [ ] Inspect network request in DevTools
- [ ] Review JSON-RPC request structure
- [ ] Check response format

**Success Criteria**:

**Exercises**:

1. How many test functions exist? (4: MinNumbers, MinSymbols, MinUppercase, MinLowercase)
2. Run tests with coverage: `go test -cover ./...`
3. What's the current coverage percentage?

### Afternoon: Write Your First Test

- [ ] Read [Testing Guide: Unit Testing](testing-guide.md#unit-testing)
- [ ] Choose a simple function to test (e.g., `pluralize` in `change_password.go:10`)
- [ ] Write test cases for edge cases
- [ ] Run your test and verify it passes

**Example Test**:

```go
func TestPluralize(t *testing.T) {
    if pluralize("number", 1) != "number" {
        t.Error("Expected singular form")
    }
    if pluralize("number", 2) != "numbers" {
        t.Error("Expected plural form")
    }
}
```

### End of Day: Code Review Practice

- [ ] Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -5`
- [ ] Pick a commit and review changes: `git show <commit-hash>`
- [ ] Read [Architecture Patterns: Design Decisions Summary](architecture-patterns.md#design-decisions-summary)
- [ ] Understand trade-offs made

**Reflection Questions**:

1. Why use JSON-RPC instead of REST?
2. Why embed static assets instead of serving from disk?
3. What are benefits of dual validation?

8. Response returned → ?
9. Success state shown → ?

## Common Beginner Questions

### Q: Why are there two validation implementations?

**A**: Frontend for UX (immediate feedback), backend for security (can't bypass client-side checks). See [Architecture Patterns: Dual Validation](architecture-patterns.md#dual-validation-frontend--backend).

### Q: Can I modify the HTML template directly?

**A**: Yes! Edit `internal/web/templates/index.html`, but note it uses Go templates syntax (`{{ .opts.MinLength }}`). Server restart required to see changes.

### Q: How do I add a new configuration option?

**A**: Follow [Development Guide: Adding Configuration Option](development-guide.md#adding-configuration-option). Update `options.Opts` struct, add flag, inject into template.

### Q: Where do I put new Go packages?

**A**: Under `internal/` directory. This makes them private to the project (Go convention).

### Q: Can I use a different CSS framework?

**A**: Technically yes, but project is built around Tailwind CSS v4. Major refactor required. Not recommended.

### Q: Why TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript?

**A**: Type safety prevents runtime errors. Strict mode enabled (`tsconfig.json`) catches bugs at compile time.

### Q: How do I debug the Go backend?

**A**: Use `log.Printf()` for simple debugging or Delve debugger for breakpoints: `dlv debug`.

### Q: What's the difference between `.env` and `.env.local`?

**A**: `.env` is committed (defaults), `.env.local` is gitignored (your local overrides). Never commit credentials!
